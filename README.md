## Intro:
Machine learning project uses past vehicle damage assessments to predict future vehicle damage assessments according to car information.
And the project purpose is Automate the vehicle damage assessment process to increase productivity without reducing the assessment accuracy.
Also as we know Digital transformation is one of the main targets of the 2030 vision. So, Our project aims to achieve digital transformation in the field of vehicle damage assessment by automating the assessment process based on machine learning without the need for assessment experts.



## The goal of the case study:
<strong> 1- Automation </strong><br>
Automate the accident damage assessment process.<br>

<strong> 2- Productivity </strong><br>
Reduce the assessment process time, to achieve higher productivity.<br>

<strong> 3- Accuracy </strong><br>
Make highly Accurate assessments by the machine learning model.<br>


## Dataset :

The dataset have more than 250k records form Taqdeer centers<br />


## Dashboard :

## Preprocessing :
We have several challenges and we solve them in this project(more details on the medium article):<br>
1-More Than 1M Records<br>
2-Mixed Inputs<br>
3-Arabic Spelling Issues<br>
4-Parts Standardization<br>
5-Informal Arabic<br>
6-Translation to English<br>
7-Combine Common Rows<br>


## The file guides :
<strong>-We have 3 Folders:</strong> <br>
1- notebooks --> All Preprocessing and machine learning and EDA's code there.<br>
2- static --> There is external files for html for Flask App<br>
3- template --> There is HTMLs files for Flask App<br>

<strong>-The rest of files is:</strong><br>
1- Procfile --> All Preprocessing and machine learning and EDA's code there.<br>
2- (XGBC_Model_19_23-21, XGBR_Model_19_23-21) --> The saved model (Regression and Classification)<br>
3- app.py --> Configration file for Flask App<br>
4- (UniqueKyes.json, parts.json) --> Json files have the unique parts for the web app<br>

## Results :

Regression :
 Total Cost<br />

- Using XGBoost:<br />
   Accuracy: 0.72 <br />
   ith 10% differance between Testing set and Training Set

Classification :
 TotalCostEvaluation<br />

- Using XGBoost:<br />
   Accuracy: 0.74 <br />
   with 1.8% differance between Testing set and Training Set

   
## Future work :

1- Develop our models<br/>
2- Testing the models in the real-world life <br />
3- Training the models with more new data from Taqdeer. <br />
4- Publish our system to use in Taqdeer centers <br />


## Recommendations:
We Would recommend the Taqdeer to Utilization of digital transformation. <br/>
